# SITARA — Mandatory Instructions for AI Coding Agents

Before editing code, read:

- `README.md`
- `docs/PRD.md`
- `docs/system_design.md`
- `docs/architecture.md`
- `docs/agents.md`
- `docs/TEST_STRATEGY.md`
- `docs/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`
- Relevant decisions in `docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`

## Non-negotiable rules

1. Use TDD: write a meaningful failing test first, implement the smallest correct change, refactor, and run focused plus regression tests.
2. Never weaken/delete tests or disable lint/security gates merely to obtain a green result.
3. Never claim a command, test, scan, or build passed unless it was executed and the result observed.
4. Never commit `.env`, credentials, tokens, private keys, production data, or confidential meeting content. Use synthetic fixtures.
5. Do not test destructively against production. Use versioned Alembic migrations and isolated test databases.
6. Enforce authorization server-side for every endpoint, object, search result, export, and file download.
7. PIC must not access full restricted minutes/Decision Brief or mutate official status, including by direct API request.
8. During a live meeting, only the designated notetaker can edit. Other authorized users are read-only.
9. Only authorized Secretariat users can change official task status. Super Admin does not automatically gain this business permission.
10. A decision may generate zero or multiple action items. Each task has one active main PIC and may have supporting PICs.
11. AI/OCR output remains a draft until a permitted human reviews it; never submit confidential data to an external service without approval.
12. Keep changes small and layered. Do not add dependencies or design patterns without a concrete need.
13. Review `git diff`, tests, migration safety, and secrets before reporting completion.

Follow the detailed workflows, test commands, tool policy, security rules, and reporting format in `docs/agents.md`. If instructions or requirements conflict, do not silently choose: report the conflict and ask for clarification where it changes product/security behavior.
